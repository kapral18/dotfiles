  # Why do we need this?
  #
  # If you check https://developer.1password.com/docs/ssh/agent/advanced#use-multiple-github-accounts
  # you will see that 1Password allows you to use multiple SSH keys for different accounts
  # by using the `IdentityFile` option in the `~/.ssh/config` file. This is a way to use
  # the same feature but for Git. This way you can use different SSH keys for different
  # repositories without changing the global `~/.ssh/config` file. The main catch is that
  # usually, you would use the private key in the `IdentityFile` option, but in this case,
  # 1Password allows you to use the public key. This is why we use the public key here.
  #
  # This solves 3 problems:
  #
  # 1. You don't have to change the global `~/.ssh/config` file to use different SSH keys
  # 2. You don't have to use the private key in the `IdentityFile` option because it is not secure.
  # 3. You can now invoke 1Password ssh key verification for Git commands not only
  # for ssh aliases as described in the 1Password documentation but also nested
  # .gitconfig architecture. Basically you can use 1Password ssh key verification
  # from different .gitconfig files in different directories without need to create
  # a separate ssh alias for each repository or directory.
  #
  # Example:
  #
  # you can find the secondary ssh key in this repos in the home/dot_ssh/secondary_public_key.pub.tmpl file
  # and it's used in home/work/private_dot_gitconfig.tmpl file
  #
