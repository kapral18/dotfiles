# General Drafting Guidance

Use this for non-Elastic repos.

Templates:

- PR: `~/.agents/github_drafting/general/templates/pr.template.md`
- Issue: `~/.agents/github_drafting/general/templates/issue.template.md`

Rules:

- Hard rules and approvals live in `~/.agents/gh.md`. Follow them.
- Delete sections that don’t apply; keep the body short and reviewable.
- Prefer bullets for changes and test plan evidence.
