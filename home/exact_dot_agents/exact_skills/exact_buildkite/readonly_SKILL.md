  Buildkite CI/CD integration. Use when the user needs to check build status,
  trigger builds, read build logs, debug failures, manage pipelines, or any
  Buildkite workflow. Triggers include "buildkite", "build", "pipeline", "CI",
  "deploy", "build log", "build failed".

# Buildkite — CI/CD

## Setup

The `buildkite` wrapper auto-detects first run and launches `scripts/setup`.

## Build Operations

```bash
# List recent builds for a pipeline
buildkite build list --pipeline SLUG

# View build details
buildkite build view BUILD_NUMBER --pipeline SLUG

# Trigger a new build
buildkite build create --pipeline SLUG --branch main --message "Deploy"

# Rebuild a failed build
buildkite build rebuild BUILD_NUMBER --pipeline SLUG

# Cancel a running build
buildkite build cancel BUILD_NUMBER --pipeline SLUG
```

## Job & Log Operations

```bash
# List jobs for a build
buildkite job list --build BUILD_NUMBER --pipeline SLUG

# View job log output
buildkite job log JOB_ID

# Download build artifacts
buildkite artifacts download --build BUILD_NUMBER --pipeline SLUG
```

## Pipeline Operations

```bash
# List all pipelines
buildkite pipeline list

# View pipeline configuration
buildkite pipeline view SLUG
```

## Failure Debugging Workflow

When a build fails, follow this sequence:

1. Find the failed build: `buildkite build list --pipeline SLUG --state failed`

2. View build details to see which jobs failed:
   `buildkite build view BUILD_NUMBER --pipeline SLUG`

3. Get the failed job's log: `buildkite job log JOB_ID`

4. Download artifacts (test reports, etc.) if available:
   `buildkite artifacts download --build BUILD_NUMBER --pipeline SLUG`

For detailed debugging patterns, load `references/build-debugging.md`.

## Output Conventions

- `buildkite` outputs JSON by default — pipe through `jq` for display or
  extraction.
- Use `buildkite api` for REST API endpoints not covered by direct commands.
- Example: `buildkite api /v2/organizations/ORG/pipelines | jq '.[].slug'`
